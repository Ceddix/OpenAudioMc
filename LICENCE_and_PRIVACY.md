By activating the software as made available on this website or through the plugin build you acknowledge that you have
carefully read and fully understood the Terms of Services as described in this document/website and that you will comply
with these Terms of Services.

The Terms of Services as described in this document are also applicable to purchases made through OpenAudioMc accounts (

This document overrides the license as used before May 20th, 2020 at 7 PM (UTC+2)

## Definitions

- The author of this document uses the term **I** and **me** to reference me, Mindgamesnl, as the author of OpenAudioMc.
- I use the term **OpenAudioMc Account** to reference personal accounts made on https://account.openaudiomc.net/
- I use the term **Client** to reference any user using the website to listen to music or have it idle in the
  background.
- I use the term **Player** to reference any Minecraft-Player who **is** online on your server.
- I use the term **OA** to reference the OpenAudioMc project.
- I use the term **Data** to describe any (stored) information used as input into OpenAudioMc (automatically by systems
  or manually by a Player)
- I use the term **Stored** to describe data as being saved on our site, regardless of session duration.
- I use the term **Server** to reference a Minecraft server or the current Minecraft server where a Player is online
  when used in the context of one.
- I use the term **Player UUID** to reference a unique identifier to a Minecraft account owned by the Player, as
  provided by Mojang and/or Microsoft.
- I use the term **Client settings** to reference settings accessed through OpenAudioMc Accounts.
- I use the term **Server-Authentication** or **Account** to describe a set of two UUID's to authenticate and
  acknowledge your server and be used as Tokens.
- I use the term **Ban** to describe the issue of a statement to deny service to a specific Server based on their Server
  Authentication.
- I use the term **Voice Chat** to describe the online calling feature (proximity voice chat), and its underlying
  services
- I use the term **Stream ID** to reference a Player-bound unique ID that directly points to their voice stream (if
  enabled)
- I use the term **Mod** or **Moderator** to reference a Player who has been granted the permission to moderate a
  Server. 

## Processed and Stored Data

- **Server-Authentication**: These tokens are stored indefinitely and are randomly generated based. These tokens have
  timestamps attached to them (date and time of creation) but are not stored with other information about the request (
  IP, or other)
- **Client Settings**: Any provided Client Settings are stored indefinitely in relation to your Server-Authentication (
  as described in the first bullet under "Processed Data"). The Client Url setting may be monitored when changed to
  check whether the specific client installation complies with the Terms (as described below). This is a semi-automatic
  process, where it only notifies Me when it changed, I then review the page manually and decide to issue a ban or
  not. (These terms are listed at the end of this document)
- **Fatal client errors**: Fatal client errors get logged in a private Discord channel where OpenAudioMc staff can look
  to assist in the help channel. This channel gets cleared every week. Logged data contains The player name whose client
  ran into a problem, the exact js error message and code, and the source that caused the issue (if applicable). This
  information will not be shared with third parties.
- **OpenAudioMc Accounts**: OpenAudioMc accounts store and process provided information (email, password, addon activation
  codes etc) for functional purposes and aren't shared with third parties by me.
- **Voice Chat**: VoiceChat uses data from your OpenAudioMc Account to provide its service. Audio
  streams **do not** get recorded, but the most recent second of audio will get saved in memory for functional reasons (
  buffering). In certain conditions, the audio stream will be shared with Moderators who do not appear in your list of voice-chat peers.
- **Dead Servers**: OpenAudioMc installations that haven't been active for over a month **and** aren't linked to a
  OpenAudioMc account will automatically be deleted, rendering the installation dead. OpenAudioMc installations *with*
  linked OpenAudioMc accounts are allowed two months of inactivity (unless they have addons installed, in which case they
  will never be deleted)
- **Uploaded Files**: OpenAudioMc is not responsible for uploaded/entered files. This includes but is not limited to
  music files, images, and other files. OpenAudioMc is not responsible for any damage caused by uploaded files. We reserve the right to completely remove uploaded files without notice if we deem it necessary.

## Purchases

- Some products/services are made available temporarily. This means that they can be used for a set amount of days,
  starting on the day when you (which means: the user/admin) manually activate the installation. Every next day counts,
  regardless of the usage of the product/service (but exceptions may be made for events or circumstances outside your
  control).
- Purchases/services/Your Account may be disabled by an OpenAudioMc team member without prior warning if/when the owning
  account (or owner of that account) violates the Terms of Services or participates/is otherwise linked with other
  behaviour related to OpenAudioMc that may be considered unacceptable.
- If your account is disabled, banned, blocked, or otherwise limited as a result of violating one or more Terms of
  Services or by participating in other behaviour related to OpenAudioMc that may be considered unacceptable, your
  purchase will not be eligible for a refund.

  limit account functionality. Please note that OpenAudioMc is not responsible for any payment chargebacks (
  this is handled by https://www.mollie.com/en)
